# CanorBot
CanorBot is a music bot for Discord, written in Java using the Discord4J and Lavaplayer APIs to do so.

## Features
It supports a variety of sources: YouTube videos by id or search results, Vimeo videos, SoundCloud videos, 
BandCamp videos, Twitch streams, YouTube streams, and Beam.pro/Mixer.com streams.

It is easy to use, admins (Users with the manage server permission) can begin setting the bot up with `/?configure set info` and go from there!
It keeps itself clean and deletes any messages relating to the bot after a period of time, usually within 2-5 minutes, reducing spam.
